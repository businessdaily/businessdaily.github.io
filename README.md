from 界面新闻, by 杜雨萌

今年一季度，三四线城市商品房成交面积同比下降42.9%。政策调整主要围绕购房补贴、提高公积金贷款或降低首付比例，以及下调房贷利率等方面进行。此外，针对二孩、三孩家庭的购房宽松政策亦是重点方向之一。预计二季度楼市调控政策将继续保持较为宽松的主基调。

## 远景的碳中和大棋局：十年一百个新园区，减掉一个日本的碳排放 | 碳案
from 36Kr, by 时氪分享

WHAT 远景科技集团与鄂尔多斯政府合作，打造全球首个零碳产业园。零碳产业园内80%电量由区域内的可再生能源（风光）发电直供，20%与电网交易，实现100%绿色零碳能源供给。

HOW 
1. 新型电力系统：大规模储能及与电网间的柔性互动。配备了高比例的电化学储能和基于氢气的长时储能；当发电量超过园区用电量时，其中有20%会卖给电网，发电量小于用电量时，园区从电网处回购绿电；
2. 零碳数字操作系统：基于物联网的零碳数字认证体系，为每一块电池提供可追溯、符合标准、经过认证的“身份证”；
3. 政策支持：多地推出低碳/零碳产业园区文件。

WHY 
1. 欧洲市场电池产品需要提供产品全生命周期的碳足迹，促使企业重视碳排放管理；
2. 绿电就地消纳，进一步提高绿电经济效益，降低企业能耗成本；
3. 电池上下游企业入驻，产业集聚效应，降低物流成本。

## IMF walkout and downgrades underscore bleak economic outlook
from Financial Times, by Chris Giles and Colby Smith

IMF managing director said on multiple occasions that Russia’s invasion was a “massive setback” for the global economy, as the fund cut forecasts for 2022 from 4.4% estimated as recently as January to 3.6%.

IMF’s fiscal and financial stability departments said that poorer countries will face increasing inflation and lower growth, and the managing director urged richer countries to step up and provide the funding required.

The G20 now is under challenging circumstances, THE G7 would like to kick Russia out of these discussions.

After all, the future of economic policymaking may tend to be more regional rather than global fora.

## Asia prices down on soft demand, further downside seen limited
from Reuters, by Marwa Rashad

Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) price were down this week which is the shoulder season, but Asian buyers are expected to start to return to the market.
```
Shoulder season: the months between winter and summer, when demand for gas is usually lower
```
China’s lockdown has lower the demand, but a higher power demand can be predicted as Asian markets could experience a high summer temperature.

European market players are concerned over possible disruptions of Russian gas as a deadline for rouble payments nears.

## How Mobility Shapes Inclusion and Sustainable Growth in Global Cities
from World Economic Forum

The white paper aims to identify potential solutions to improve inclusivity in mobility, by analysing 3 cities with different mobility modes: Chicago, Berlin and Beijing. 

### Beijing
This high-density megacity can become nearly 30% more efficient, saving commuters about five days-worth of travel time per year:
* Pain point: Very high demand has overwhelmed Beijing’s public transit network, with queuing times to get into some train stations consistently over 15 minutes, leading many residents to choose driving as an alternative.
* Solution: A digital platform for metro reservations to flatten peak-hour demand and reduce commute time for rush hours.
* Benefit: This equates to a 29% average reduction in travel time for the service users in the modelling for Beijing, an average reduction of 115 hours waiting a year per user.

### Berlin
The report shows how this compact, middleweight city is raising $295 million more per year for inclusive mobility projects:
* Pain point: As central districts have become gentrified, populations have been pushed further from the city centre, where public transport is more limited and fragmented. Berliners in these peripheral areas take about 27% more time commuting than central Berliners.
* Solution: Creating differentiated service levels for public transit increases usage and brings in additional revenue that can be used to improve public mobility systems for the underserved.
* Benefit: A differentiated service level on public transit increased the share of public transit trips by 11% while at the same time generating 28% higher revenue for the public transport operator – an equivalent of $295 million – that can be used to improve access for underserved populations.

### Chicago
A car-centric city such as Chicago can give low-income neighbourhoods access to hundreds of thousands of more jobs:
* Pain point: Low-income households in Chicago spend up to 35% of their income on transportation, due to the high cost of vehicle ownership and reliance on cars for mobility. Average work commute time on public transit for individuals in low-income areas is also nearly 15 minutes longer when compared to residents in some high-income areas.
* Solution: Introducing on-demand shuttles to cover the first and last mile of transport can greatly increase access for underserved communities.
* Benefit: The solution would increase the share of public transit usage in Chicago by 26% and would broaden the number of jobs reachable in 40 minutes – the rough ceiling for a desirable commuting time – by 90%; this would result in improved access to 224,000 jobs from neighbourhoods that did not have access before.

## Cracking the code on cyber insurance
from the Indicator from Planet Money, by Paddy Hirsch and Darian Woods

US business has been being targets by Russian. Not all the companies are capable of building better systems to keep the hackers out, and many of them rely on regular insurance to covering the losses. 

* property & casualty insurance: covering all risks, incl business interruption bc of malware, with higher compensation, may deny bc of “war exclusion”
* speciality cyber insurance: preparing for new risks, may be provided by the govt in the future

## WEF: 统一ESG标准的可能性
from 界面新闻, by Emily Bayley and 刘益

WHAT 世界经济论坛发布了一项全球性的倡议，旨在整合全球现有若干框架标准中的指标和披露内容，以形成一个全球统一的可持续发展报告方案。

HOW 与key stakeholders接触，与国际报告准则基金会的技术准备工作小组合作。最大的挑战是，这是一项自愿性的努力，目前已有160多家公司加入了该倡议。

WHY 当前还没有公认的ESG或非财务报告的国际标准。公司被要求根据许多不同的标准框架进行ESG信息披露，这无法帮助他们表现自己工作的进展，也很难与stakeholders和资本市场分享连续性及可比性的信息。

Hi, This is Lu. I have a wide range of interests, expertise and experience in urban policy. However, during a long period of time floating in the job market, I develop an interest in business world, as nothing is really separate from business, including public sector, of course.

## Why this blog
I want to keep track of my learning of business, including energy sector, climate change, ESG and so on. I learn from news, academic journals and reports.
