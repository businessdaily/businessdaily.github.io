## Cracking the code on cyber insurance
from the Indicator from Planet Money, by Paddy Hirsch and Darian Woods.

US business has been being targets by Russian. Not all the companies are capable of building better systems to keep the hackers out, and many of them rely on regular insurance to covering the losses. 

* property & casualty insurance: covering all risks, incl business interruption bc of malware, with higher compensation, may deny bc of “war exclusion”
* speciality cyber insurance: preparing for new risks, may be provided by the govt in the future

## WEF: 统一ESG标准的可能性
from 界面新闻, by Emily Bayley and 刘益

WHAT 世界经济论坛发布了一项全球性的倡议，旨在整合全球现有若干框架标准中的指标和披露内容，以形成一个全球统一的可持续发展报告方案。

HOW 与key stakeholders接触，与国际报告准则基金会的技术准备工作小组合作。最大的挑战是，这是一项自愿性的努力，目前已有160多家公司加入了该倡议。

WHY 当前还没有公认的ESG或非财务报告的国际标准。公司被要求根据许多不同的标准框架进行ESG信息披露，这无法帮助他们表现自己工作的进展，也很难与stakeholders和资本市场分享连续性及可比性的信息。

Hi, This is Lu. I have a wide range of interests, expertise and experience in urban policy. However, during a long period of time floating in the job market, I develop an interest in business world, as nothing is really separate from business, including public sector, of course.

## Why this blog
I want to keep track of my learning of business, including energy sector, climate change, ESG and so on. I learn from news, academic journals and reports.
